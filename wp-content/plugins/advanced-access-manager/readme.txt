AAM is well documented so even unexperienced WordPress user can easily understand 
how to use it in the most efficient way.

AAM the main objectives are to control access to your:

* posts, pages, custom post types and categories;
* backend metaboxes and widgets as well as frontend widgets;
* backend menu;
* comments;

`//Get AAM_Core_Subject. This object allows you to work with access control
//for current logged-in user or visitor
$user = AAM::getUser();

//Example 1. Get Post with ID 10 and check if current user has access to read it
//on the frontend side of the website. If true then access denied to read this post.
$user->getObject('post', 10)->has('frontend.read');

//Example 2. Get Admin Menu object and check if user has access to Media menu.
//If true then access denied to this menu
$user->getObject('menu')->has('upload.php');
